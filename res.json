Behavior**\r\n`BrowserWindow.setIgnoreMouseEvents()` should keep working after refreshing the page with `CTRL + R`. \r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nRunning `browserWindow.setIgnoreMouseEvents({forward:

Please advise on how to adjust the default volume to match. This seems to be a **known issue** of electron but I have not been able to find any solution for it.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue, create a bare minimum electron app with an html video tag.\r\n`<video autoplay src=\"vid.mp4\"></video>`\r\n\r\n1. Run index.html in your browser, and note the volume\r\n2. Play the video through a native video player on your OS, and note the volume\r\n3. Run the electron app, and note the volume\r\n\r\nYou will observe that cases 1 and 2 have consistent and normal volume, while in case 3 the volume is significantly lower. I have found this behaviour to be irrelavant to the autoplay policy of Chromium.\r\n\r\nI am using Windows 64-bit and 64-bit electron binaries. I have tried versions 3.0.5 and 4 beta.\r\n\r\nFurther Investigation: After some trials, I have found that some media players made with electron (such as [this one](https://electronjs.org/apps/sharp-tune)) also suffer from the exact same issue.\r\n\r\nPlease recommend some solutions or workarounds, thanks"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/15368","id":373540447,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzM1NDA0NDc=","number":15368,"title":"tray.displayBalloon only works one time.","user":{"login":"sgd2z","id":18012933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDEyOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18012933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z","html_url":"https://github.com/sgd2z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgd2z/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193723572,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjM1NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/blocked/need-info","name":"blocked/need-info","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":520323169,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjAzMjMxNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/bug%20:beetle:","name":"bug :beetle:","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":97403549,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQwMzU0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/platform/windows","name":"platform/windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-10-24T15:23:45Z","updated_at":"2018-10-24T21:15:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"* Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`: v4.0.0-nightly.20180929\r\n* Operating System (Platform and Version): Windows 10\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nTray balloon notification shows up every time tray.displayBalloon is called.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\ntray.displayBalloon only works one time.

now, to start a file drag you call `WebContents.startDrag({ file:<path>, icon:<path> })`.

your feature request related to a problem?

Ideally a way of subscribing to change events, equivalent to `systemPreferences.subscribeNotification('AppleInterfaceThemeChangedNotification', callback)`. Or perhaps the `color-changed` event (or another event) would be fired by `systemPreferences`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOn Windows the state of the dark mode setting [is stored in

Description of Change\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your Pull Request. Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n\r\nContributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of accessibility problems related to menus that I've found:\r\n - The `Windows Narrator` couldn't announce any menu items\r\n - The menu bar on `Windows` (and I guess `Linux` too) was not accessible by keyboard\r\n - #11587\r\n\r\nThe first fix was given to us by the `Chromium 69` upgrade, which allowed the `Windows Narrator` to read the menus. This is because chromium's `UIAutomation` API implementation is not yet complete, and that's what the narrator uses on `Windows` (but the implementation progressed from 68 to 69 to allow the menus to be read).\r\n\r\nThe menu bar was not accessible because we basically didn't `focus` the `View`, which in turn didn't give it keyboard events. This was done because some commands in the menu (like copy) depend on the actual content being focused, instead of the bar. I fixed this by returning the focus before the command executes. Also, focusing the menu bar was not enough, since we used a plain `View` for the bar, which didn't implement any keyboard navigation of it's items. I changed the base class to `AccessiblePaneView`, which implements that navigation (should fix #2504).\r\n\r\n![electron-acc-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1690458/47253178-3d8e2c80-d450-11e8-9c0f-76bf17415ecd.gif)\r\n\r\n#11587 was caused by the fact that the tray icon's context menu was spawned without a `Widget`, since it's not necessary to have a `BrowserWindow` to have an icon in the tray. The `Widget` is important because that's what actually captures keyboard events, and the menus leech off their parent `Widgets` for those events. I added a temporary non-visual `Widget` to the menu that gets destroyed when the menu closes, which fixed the issue.\r\n\r\n![electron-acc-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1690458/47253182-41ba4a00-d450-11e8-9ea0-f263d99f35f7.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

I have read abt this issue on another thread here but it was last updated an year ago and mentions the problem being related to electron not having GTK3 support. I presume this has been achieved so I dont know what to do now.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/15191","id":370550565,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzA1NTA1NjU=","number":15191,"title":"flaky

I tried to use dialog feature of electron, which gives me the opportunity to attach file dialog, but it lacks performance, when I try to upload files more then 500-1000mb, I need to open them with fs.readFile or http get request and make them blob. Browser native file dialog do this for me and it works maybe 100 times faster then with fs.

Please describe.**\r\nIn windows tablet mode, you may want to change your UI. There is apps that enlarge the title bar or hide the title bar buttons since they are useless (in tablet mode, every window is forced into fullscreen mode and minimizing is disabled). The is no way to detect tablet mode in electron.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n~~Something like systemPreferences.tabletMode() and a `tablet-mode-changed` should be available~~\r\nWe need a BrowserWindow instance method like `window.getUserInteractionMode()` that gives us the primary input mode for a view. `window.resize` event should be sufficient to listen to changes to tablet mode. Here is more info: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160706-00/?p=93815\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI looked into going to the Browser API  in renderer, but there is no clear way to check if a device is in tablet mode. You can basically just check if there is touch available, which is not the same.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is outlook hiding their title bar buttons in tablet mode.\r\n<img width=\"850\"

Description of Change\r\nThe following modules are internally implemented using `remote.require` when `sandbox` is enabled:\r\n- `require('electron').screen`\r\n- `require('child_process')`\r\n- `require('fs')`\r\n- `require('os')`\r\n- `require('path')`\r\n\r\nInstead of being magically available in sandboxed renderers, the app should explicitly load these modules via the `remote` module (unless it is disabled via https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/13028). Alternative approach is to only use them in the main process and broker all requests from the renderer via IPC.\r\n\r\nMaking the usage explicit will also help understanding that there is performance overhead related to the `remote` module.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [x] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md)\r\n- [x] relevant documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines)\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\nNotes: Deprecated modules internally using `remote.require` in sandboxed renderer context."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/15144","id":369806605,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjk4MDY2MDU=","number":15144,"title":"N-API : napi_call_threadsafe_function isn't properly working when page is loaded by \"loadURL\"","user":{"login":"orange4glace","id":17820596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIwNTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17820596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace","html_url":"https://github.com/orange4glace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orange4glace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1054948123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU0OTQ4MTIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/4-0-x","name":"4-0-x","color":"8d9ee8","default":false},{"id":520323169,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjAzMjMxNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/bug%20:beetle:","name":"bug :beetle:","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":97403549,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQwMzU0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/platform/windows","name":"platform/windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-10-13T14:20:50Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T23:32:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Electron version : 4.0.0-beta.2\r\nOperating system : Windows 10 x64\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nnapi_threadsafe_function should be called WHEN uv queue is free\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nnapi_thread_function is called only once or never even uv queue is free\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nHere's google drive link for download\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1BRxUXs2OyqwjvX9oE-f7eilrFamDnfr7\r\n(link updated)\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n1. install packages\r\n`$npm install`\r\n2.

[Security Tutorial](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/security.md) contains a section about [disabling `eval()`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/security.md#7-override-and-disable-eval) to prevent the application from evaluation code that is not known in advance.\r\n\r\nThe problem of this explanation is that there is another, not blockable way, to evaluate dynamic JavaScript strings:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// The following statement prints: 'Hello world!' in the console\r\nnew Function([], 'console.log(\"Hello world!\");')();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes useless this section in the doc because it is not possible at all to prevent dynamic evaluation of JavaScript (as the `Function` entity is part of the native library and all functions depend on it)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15058","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15058/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15058/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15058/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/15058","id":368667823,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjg2Njc4MjM=","number":15058,"title":"dump_syms

This allows the system to have en-CZ locale even through there is no czech region associated with english (the example results in English language with Czech data/number format/currency). However Chrome only presents region in locale based on system language.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the API returning the OS region which can be then used for globalization. With the knowledge of region the applications would be able to show proper localization as any other native app.\r\n\r\n##### Checklist\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] relevant documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines)\r\n\r\n##### Release Notes\r\nNotes: feat: provide user system´s region with app.getLocaleCountryCode() "},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/issues/15031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/15031","id":367989260,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjc5ODkyNjA=","number":15031,"title":"Breaking change in node_headers release artifact","user":{"login":"felixrieseberg","id":1426799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1426799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg","html_url":"https://github.com/felixrieseberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixrieseberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1054948123,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU0OTQ4MTIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/4-0-x","name":"4-0-x","color":"8d9ee8","default":false},{"id":992069387,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTIwNjkzODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/app-feedback-program","name":"app-feedback-program","color":"0052cc","default":false},{"id":991063084,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTEwNjMwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/app/Slack","name":"app/Slack","color":"6af922","default":false},{"id":97431925,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQzMTkyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron/labels/documentation%20:notebook:","name":"documentation :notebook:","color":"6addf7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-10-08T23:39:30Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T17:56:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"* Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`: v4.0.0-nightly.20181006\r\n* Operating System (Platform and Version):\r\n* Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version` on last known working Electron version (if applicable): v3.0.3 (and earlier)\r\n\r\nWe're having trouble compiling native code with nightly builds of Electron 4.0 due to changes in the node_headers files.\r\n\r\n@nornagon helped me with the research and we believe [that the bug might actually be in `cmake-js`](https://github.com/cmake-js/cmake-js/blob/45f419bc78969908478fc9a624c8588a0127b40f/lib/es6/runtimePaths.js#L74-L84).
